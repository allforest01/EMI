# EMI
I have developed this Discord bot to oversee the OI training for the underclassmen in the computer science team at my high school.
Functions of EMI:
```

eagle_view                              is the eagle's view
add_problem $problem_id $problem_url    add problem
get_problem $problem_id                 get problem url
add_user $user_id $user_name            add user
